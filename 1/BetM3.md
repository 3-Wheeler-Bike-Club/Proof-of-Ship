# BetM3 No-Loss Betting DApp Architecture

## Overview
A decentralized application that enables social betting without risk of losing the principal amount. Users can bet against each other while their stakes generate yield through Ubeswap, which becomes the prize pool.

## Core Features

### 1. Betting System
- Create bet between two or more parties
- Lock staked assets (cUSD/CELO) into Ubeswap liquidity pools
- Generate yield during the bet duration
- Distribute yield to winners while returning principal to all participants

### 2. Smart Contract Components
1. BetManager Contract
   - Create and manage bets
   - Handle stake deposits
   - Track bet status and participants
   - Interface with Ubeswap for yield generation

2. YieldStrategy Contract
   - Manage liquidity provision on Ubeswap
   - Track yield generation
   - Handle yield distribution

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Bet Creation
- Bet creation form
  * Participants selection
  * Stake amount input
  * Duration setting
  * Bet condition/outcome definition

#### Bet Management
- Active bets display
  * Current yield generated
  * Time remaining
  * Participants list
  * Stake amounts

#### Wallet Integration
- Connect wallet
- Display balances
- Show transaction history
- Handle asset approvals

#### Yield Tracking
- Display APY from Ubeswap
- Show accumulated yield
- Project potential winnings

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Flow
1. Bet Creation
   ```
   User A creates bet → User B accepts → Both deposit stakes
   ↓
   Stakes locked in Ubeswap LP
   ↓
   Yield generation period
   ↓
   Bet resolution → Yield distributed to winner(s)
   ↓
   Principal returned to all participants
   ```

### Frontend Flow
1. User Journey
   ```
   Connect Wallet → Create/Accept Bet → Approve Token Spend
   ↓
   Monitor Active Bets → View Yield Generation
   ↓
   Confirm Bet Outcome → Claim Winnings
   ```

### Integration Points
1. Ubeswap Integration
   - LP token management
   - Yield tracking
   - APY calculations

2. Wallet Integration
   - Transaction signing
   - Balance checking
   - Token approvals

## Data Structures

### Bet Object
```typescript
interface Bet {
  id: string;
  creator: address;
  participants: address[];
  stakeAmount: BigNumber;
  totalStaked: BigNumber;
  yieldGenerated: BigNumber;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  status: BetStatus;
  condition: string;
  outcome: BetOutcome;
}
```

### User State
```typescript
interface UserState {
  activeBets: Bet[];
  totalStaked: BigNumber;
  pendingYield: BigNumber;
  claimableWinnings: BigNumber;
}
```

## Implementation Priorities

   - [ ] Stake handling
   - [ ] Simple yield tracking

2. Frontend
   - [ ] Bet creation interface
   - [ ] Wallet connection
   - [ ] Basic bet display

### Phase 2: Yield Integration
1. Smart Contracts
   - [ ] Ubeswap integration
   - [ ] Yield strategy implementation
   - [ ] Automated yield distribution

2. Frontend
   - [ ] Yield tracking display
   - [ ] APY calculator
   - [ ] Winning projections

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features

## Security Considerations
1. Smart Contract Security
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Access control
   - Pause functionality
   - Emergency withdrawals

2. User Security
   - Transaction signing confirmations
   - Clear bet terms display
   - Transparent yield calculations
   - Principal protection guarantees

## Testing Strategy
1. Smart Contracts
   - Unit tests for all functions
   - Integration tests with Ubeswap
   - Yield generation simulation
   - Security audits

2. Frontend
   - Component testing
   - Integration testing
   - User flow testing
   - Mobile responsiveness

## Notes
- Focus on user experience and clear bet terms
- Ensure transparent yield tracking
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider gas optimization
- Plan for upgradability
