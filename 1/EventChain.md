## Goal for This Proof of Ship

The goal is to develop a decentralized event management platform on the Celo blockchain. The dApp will allow users to:

- Create an event.
- View a list of events created by themselves and others.
- Join an event.
- View detailed event information.
- Delete an event (only if they are the owner).

### Weekly Milestones

**Week 1:**

- Set up the smart contract for event creation, listing, and deletion.
- Implement event ownership validation for deletion.
- Deploy the initial smart contract on the Celo testnet.

**Week 2:**

- Develop the front end with React.js and integrate the smart contract.
- Implement event listing and detailed views.
- Allow users to join events.

**Week 3:**

- Finalize UI/UX improvements.
- Test smart contract interactions thoroughly.
- Deploy the dApp and verify contracts on Celo.

**Week 4:**

- Bug fixes and optimizations.
- Prepare documentation and finalize submission.

## Detailed Description of the Work Done During the Contest

- Developed and deployed a Solidity smart contract for event management.
- Integrated the smart contract with a React.js front end.
- Implemented event creation, listing, and deletion functionalities.
- Ensured ownership validation for event deletion.
- Conducted smart contract testing and deployed on Celo.

## Problem

Traditional event management platforms are centralized and may lack transparency. Users often have to rely on third-party services that control event data.

## Solution

A decentralized event management platform where users can create, join, and manage events with full ownership using smart contracts. The blockchain ensures transparency and eliminates the need for intermediaries.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** React.js for UI.
- **Backend:** Celo smart contracts written in Solidity.
- **Storage:** On-chain event data stored within the contract.
- **Wallet Integration:** Celo wallet for user authentication and transactions.

## Deployed Contract Addresses on Celo

## Contracts Should Be Verified
