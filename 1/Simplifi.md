# Project Name
### Simplifinance
A platform of decentralized pools for short-term lending and borrowing services. At Simplifi, we provide a groundbreaking approach to peer-to-peer group lending and borrowing that combines inclusivity, transparency, and control. While other lending platforms rely on centralized liquidity pools with predetermined and algorithm-driven interest rates, Simplifi flips the script.

## Former Participation in Celo Hackathons
Simplifinance has not pariticipate in any of the Celo hackathons.

## Goal for this Proof of Ship
Sequel to research we conducted, in a bid to create excellent user experience via intuitive easy-to-use interface, protocols, and techologies, our goal is to convert Simplifinance to a user-friendly Celo-AI-Safe-powered deFi app to reduce deployment and interaction costs, improve and smooth UI/UX, and better code optimization leveraging bot and miniApp, AI models/agents, Safe protocol, and the Celo blockchain. We have set out the following milestones to help us achieve the set goal.

## Detailed description of the work you did during the contest
- Link to PR for feature 1 - Incoming

## Problem
- High interest rate monopoly.
- Centralized and rigid liquidity pattern.
- Low transparency and financial exclusion (especially for the lower class of users).

## Solution
- Near-zero interest loans via peer-funding mechanism.
- User-driven liquidity pool through our FlexPool design.
- Enhanced flexibility and inclusion for all class of users.
- Trust and transparency.
- Expandable liquidity.

By blending traditional group lending practices with blockchain tecehnology, Simplifi creates a financial solution that's transparent, inclusive, and uniquely user-focused.

## Architecture

This project is in two parts - a web-app and a mini-app. The frontend part lets users interact with the backend built into smart contracts. The mini-app, targeted at mobile devices uses an AI-powered bot-like mechanism with Safe Smart wallet integration to ease user interaction, povides notification services to users about important events such as the getFinance time, payback time, who is getting finance, grace periods, liquidation attemps, and overall information about their positions etc.
In the future, our plan is to have Simplifinance run on multiple chains
