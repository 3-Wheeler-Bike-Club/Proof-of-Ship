**Problem**
Traditional seed marketplaces lack transparency, trust, and efficiency in transactions between farmers and buyers.

**Solution**
A blockchain-based seed marketplace that ensures transparency, security, and direct transactions between buyers and sellers without intermediaries.

**Architecture**

- **Smart Contracts:** Handles seed listings, purchases, ownership tracking, and reviews.
- **Frontend:** React.js-based UI for user interaction with filtering and search capabilities.
- **Backend:** Uses Celo blockchain for data storage and transaction validation.
- **User Dashboard:** Provides an overview of purchased and listed seeds, along with reviews and ratings.

**Deployed Contract Addresses on Celo**

**Contracts Should be Verified**
