Goal for this Proof of Ship:

    Build a new full-stack dApp from scratch using MERN, to deepen my knowledge of backend programming.
    Experiment the use of AI agents on the full-stack dApp
    Consider adding them as features into Esusu
    Test out ideas for the Agentathon hackathon
    Also consider Ethglobal AI Agent hackathon and Safe Agentathon => Implemented DCA and streaming of funds via agents
